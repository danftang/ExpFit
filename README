This is an algorithm for fitting a sum of the form
y_i = sum_n A_n k^i
to an antisymmetric function

Dan F. Tang

* The algorithm is described in the accompanying paper (interpolation.pdf).

* More documentation coming soon, along with ready made fits to the cot function!

* This code uses the Eigen library available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

* Use the code by creating a std::vector<double> containing one half of the antisymmetric function you want to fit, create and instance of an AntisymmetricExpFit, using the vector to construct the instance. The fit itself can be performed by calling AntisymmetricExpFit::fit(e) where e is the acceptable error in the approximant.

The resulting approximant can be read off from member vectors 'k' and 'A'.

* Thanks to the CICADA research group at the department of Mathematics at Manchester University for funding this research.
